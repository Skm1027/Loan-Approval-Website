# This code is the main Streamlit app for loan approval prediction.
# It allows users to input applicant details and get predictions using either a Random Forest or Logistic Regression model.
# The inputs are encoded in the same way as during model training, and the prediction results are displayed with a confidence score.
# The app uses the `predict_loan` function from the `predict` module to perform the prediction.
# The user can select the model type and view the prediction results interactively.
# The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear feedback on the loan approval status and confidence level.
# The app is built using Streamlit, a popular framework for
